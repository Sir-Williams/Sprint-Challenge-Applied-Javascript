1:  DOM is a way for html to be presented in object form. It can be used to change
    elements without changing the original code. I can also be used to manipulate
    the page and make screen actions happen.

2:  An event is an action that happens from something activating on the screen.

3:  An event listener is an method that is looking for an action to happen like
    click or scroll.

4:  You would switch a NodeList to an Array so you can access elements much easier
    and make elements more code efficient.

5:  A component is anything that can be seen on the screen like buttons, headers,
    and anchors.
